## Analysis Overview
The goal of this analysis was to get a picture of the weather conditions on Oahu to determine if it was a good island to set up a surf and ice cream shop. Rainy conditions are not favorable to either surfing or ice cream eatsing, and neithger are cold conditions. The analysis only covers the months of June and December, as these are the month with the solstices, thus the apex of both Summer and Winter conditions. This eases the burden of looking at all data over a year.
