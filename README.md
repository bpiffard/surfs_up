## Analysis Overview
The goal of this analysis was to get a picture of the weather conditions on Oahu to determine if it was a good island to set up a surf and ice cream shop. Rainy conditions are not favorable to either surfing or ice cream eatsing, and neithger are cold conditions. The analysis only covers the months of June and December, as these are the month with the solstices, thus the apex of both Summer and Winter conditions. This eases the burden of looking at all data over a year.
## Results
### First a look at the precipitation data...
![June Precipitation](https://github.com/bpiffard/surfs_up/blob/27a17006513c8b17299a63f3dc35f4b21f4cb0eb/Images/June%20precipitation.png)
![December Precipitation](https://github.com/bpiffard/surfs_up/blob/27a17006513c8b17299a63f3dc35f4b21f4cb0eb/Images/December%20precipitation.png)
- As you can see, the average daily rainfall between the two months of June and December are incredibly close. Closer thatn 0.01 units. This suggests that the monthly variation of rain is low in Hawaii, which makes sense as it is located in the tropics. Weather in the tropics varies little throughout the year, as well as the length of the day. 
### Now a look at temperatures
![June Temps](https://github.com/bpiffard/surfs_up/blob/27a17006513c8b17299a63f3dc35f4b21f4cb0eb/Images/June%20temps.png)
![December Temps](https://github.com/bpiffard/surfs_up/blob/27a17006513c8b17299a63f3dc35f4b21f4cb0eb/Images/December%20temps.png)
- As with precipitation, the variation between the two monts hs is low. THe average temperature between June and December are only different by three degrees, truly hardly noticible
- The difference in the lowest recorded temperature between these two months was higher than the difference in averages and in maximum tempoeratures. This is mildly interesting, but the difference is only 8 degrees. Nothing to write home about. THe difference between the maximum temperature and minimum temperature per month respectively is higher than this difference.
## Summary
I think I misunderstood this question, and simply read two additional queries in general, and not for June amd December in particular. However, I only noticed this error after spending considerable time doing a different analysis, and as I am very proud of that work, I am going to present the data from the work I did do. Please enjoy these bar charts that present precipitation and temperature averages per month.
